This project was to continue getting better at creating my own self-led projects and identifying how I think and work as an engineer.
The artwork was all done by one of my friends. I saw that they were showcasing their art on Tumblr. However, I thought it would be a 
good idea for them and practice for me, if I were to create a art portfolio using their artwork. 
I wanted to keep experimenting and showing myself what I can create as an engineer. 


Future update:
- Will implement Javascript for the horizontal scroll on the slides section
- will change layout and color scheme to have a more polished look and experience in relation to the art and how a website such as this should appeal to the general user
- Need to fix issue where large/medium screen users click on the list of pictures and the page scrolls down which obstructs the user's view of the slides
